                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>The Smith Fund was founded on January 8th, 2024 and is based in South Carolina. The Smith Fund is managed by Jacob and Gavin Smith, two passionate wealth managers with a shared vision of delivering superior investment returns for clients. Jacob and Gavin are committed to providing personalized, transparent, and thoughtful management of capital. Though they are young and the fund was born only a year and a half ago, timeless lessons have been learned in that short span of time and that learning will not stop. As ambitious and determined young men (being only 19), Jacob and Gavin are not stopping until their clients are satisfied and more. The fund's first year goal was to grow the fund AUM to $10,000, which we exceeded by 65% by growing the fund to $16,500 by the end of the year. They have no plans on stopping this momentum. Much of the Smith Fund's philosophy is built on the greats such as Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffet.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Our investment philosophy is built on a disciplined approach that combines
                    deep fundamental analysis with a keen understanding of market psychology.
                    We believe in identifying undervalued opportunities by thoroughly examining
                    the financial health, growth potential, and competitive advantages of
                    businesses. We look for positive and growing free cash flow, low debt, and wide economic moats. By focusing on long-term value, we seek investments with strong
                    fundamentals that are overlooked or misunderstood by the market. While we
                    utilize a range of technical indicators to time entries and exits effectively, our
                    core strategy is grounded in finding companies with solid growth prospects
                    that can withstand market fluctuations. Additionally, we use strategies like LEAPS to
                    capitalize on price movements with minimal risk exposure.
