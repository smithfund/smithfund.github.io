                <p>The Smith Fund was founded on January 8th, 2024 and is based in South Carolina. The Smith Fund is managed by Jacob Smith and Gavin Smith, two passionate wealth managers with a shared vision of delivering superior investment returns for clients. Jacob and Gavin are committed to providing personalized, transparent, and thoughtful management of capital. Though the fund is young and was born only a year ago, timeless lessons have been learned in that short span of time and that learning will not stop. As ambitious and determined young men, Jacob and Gavin are not stopping until their clients are satisfied and more. The fund's first year goal was to grow the fund AUM to $10,000, which we exceeded by 65% by growing the fund to $16,500 by the end of the year. THey have no plans on stopping this momentum. Much of the Smith Fund's philosophy is built on the greats such as Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, and Warren Buffet.</p>
